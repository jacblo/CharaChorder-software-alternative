# CharaChorder-software-alternative
 a software version of the CharaChorder for any keyboard

# Usage
1. isntalling pynput with pip
2. start the script
3. go into a text editor of choice
4. press escape to reset it so it ignores things such as ctrl and alt and whatever you pressed since you began the program
4. write a chord. (remember that keybaords not made for characording cannot always get all the keys you press at the same time so you can type them all in very quick succession and have overlap, remember that order doesn't make a difference)
5. press space and it will replace it with whatever it thinks matches better
6. have fun!
7. press shift+esc to stop the program.

tip - if it stops working for some reason, press escape to restart.
